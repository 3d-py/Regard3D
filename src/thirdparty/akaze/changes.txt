Changes to original AKAZE code:

- Replaced all occurrences of #ifdef _OPENMP to #ifdef AKAZE_USE_OPENMP, since we don't want that AKAZE uses OpenMP internally
- Small performance optimisations: replaced pow(x, 2) with x*x, double constants with float where applicable etc.
- Bug fix: Initialized matrix Lt and Lstep with 0 (was uninitialized memory access)
